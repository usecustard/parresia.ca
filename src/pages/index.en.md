title: PARRÊSIA CREATION COMPANY
excerpt: "Multidisciplinaire et indisciplinée, notre approche pulvérise les hypocrisies qui nous emprisonnent dans une illusion de progrès, pour ne garder que l’essentiel: la conviction que la vérité blessante est l’arme la plus redoutable du théâtre."

      <strong>PARRÊSIA CREATION COMPANY</strong> was founded in Montreal in 2017 by Ana Pfeiffer Quiroz, Anna Beaupré Moulounda, and Thomas Leblanc.

      Our first show, <strong>HAPPY HOUR</strong>, will be filmed and shared on the Web with Théâtre Aux Écuries from 1-11 April 2021.

      From Lima, from Rouyn-Noranda, from Congo, from Montréal-Nord, from the Pacific coast of Peru, from Côte-Saint-Paul, Gaspésie, the suburbs, Mile-End – from elsewhere, from everywhere, from nowhere – we are descending into the battle arena.

      Our theatrical works are manifestos rooted in our contradictions – our inner, political, artistic, social, and political tensions.

      We thwart expectations and explode stereotypes. In excavating our intimate truths, we leave a field of ruins onstage and in the minds of our spectators. We dance upon the grave of a culture collapsing under its own weight.

      Multidisciplinary (and undisciplined), our approach pulverizes the hypocrisies that imprison us within the mere illusion of progress. We preserve only the essential: the conviction that the hurtful, galvanizing truth is the most formidable weapon of the theatre.

      We are Parrêsia.

      <small>Parrêsia: “It is the courage of the truth in the one who speaks and takes the risk of saying, in spite of everything, all the truth that he thinks – but it is also the courage of the interlocutor who accepts as true the hurtful <br/>truth that he hears.” – Michel Foucault, 1984</small>

          Arriving in Montreal in 2010, Ana Pfeiffer Quiroz is an actress and director trained at the National Theatre School of Lima in Peru. After graduating, Ana worked as an acting coach on several film sets before persuing film and technology practices at New York University (NYU). After her arrival to Quebec, Ana felt challenged by the low representation of immigrant women artists in Quebec’s French-language theatre, and completed the research-creation project Sans étiquette as part of her master’s degree in theatre at UQAM. In 2016, Ana brought together artists of different origins and staged the performance Parrêsia at the Espace Georges-Émile-Lampalme. Journalist Mario Girard (La Presse) praised her approach in a column that questioned the “nous Québécois.” In 2020, Ana will take on the role of director and dramaturge of Happy Hour in the intimate hall of Théâtre Prospero. She is also a doctoral student of Arts Studies and Practice at UQAM.

In 2013, she joined the comedy collective, Les Lemmelettes; informed by this experience, she now presents her first one-woman show, Faite au Québec. She is also an author, and presents her first play Sans pays in several cities in Quebec.

      A striking duet: the man speaks candidly about his childhood and the discovery of his sexuality, while the woman confides in him about her disconcerting relationship with motherhood and her parentage. Two people, played by Thomas Leblanc and Anna Beaupré Moulounda, reveal themselves crudely, in bits and pieces, giving precarious voice to the otherwise unspeakable. Raw, visceral texts inhabit the stage. The actors’ presence, close and frank, incites them to deliver stories that confront us with the monstrosity of our societies – and ourselves. Regardless of our cultural origins, the pieces of life dig into the deepest grooves of our humanity. Far from cynicism, death, sex, violence and family are scrutinized intimately and without pity.

        PRACTICE AND CONSIDERATIONS

        Performance. Getting to the childcare centre on time. Set writing. Testimonials. Mothers as artists. Gay sex. Challenging “theatre school.” Where are the accents onstage? Completing a PhD to gain respect. Rehearsing in a living room. The locked doors of institutional theatres. Committees that don’t work out. Wanting to kill. Forcing yourself to laugh and cry. Diversity, inclusion, bullshit. Solidarity. Dreaming of Lima and Avignon. Tearing up. Starting over.
